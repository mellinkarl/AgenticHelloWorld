      "user_input": "# Methods\n\nWe evaluated a routing and refinement pipeline for large language models on a corpus of 312 English research abstracts collected in May 2024. Texts were deduplicated via normalized string matching and filtered to lengths between 120 and 280 tokens. The dataset was split 60/20/20 into train/dev/test (187/62/63 items) with stratification by domain label (biomedicine, computer science, and social science).\nTwo prompting strategies were compared: (A) instruction-only (baseline) and (B) instruction-plus-schema (ours). All models were queried with temperature = 0.2, top-p = 0.95, max\\_tokens = 128, and nucleus sampling enabled. For each input we sampled k = 3 candidates and used a lightweight refiner that prefers candidates satisfying JSON schema constraints and penalizes hallucinated fields via a rule score (-1 per violation).\nRouting proceeded in two stages. A rule router first inspected surface cues (presence of keywords “IRB,” “randomized,” “GPU,” or “regression”) to assign a tentative domain. An LLM router then confirmed or overrode this label using a short hypothesis prompt. When conflicts occurred, the refiner requested one re-generation with the stricter schema.\nEvaluation on the test split used exact-match for schema validity, F1 for key-phrase extraction, and accuracy for domain routing. The baseline achieved 71.4% schema validity and 76.2% routing accuracy. Our method achieved 78.9% schema validity and 81.0% routing accuracy. Average latency per example was 842 ms (baseline) versus 1,036 ms (ours). To support downstream auditing, all runs logged a machine-readable diff between the best candidate and its refined counterpart, using a unified-diff format with contextual radius = 2.",
      "draft": "Okay, I understand. This describes an experiment comparing two prompting strategies for a routing and refinement pipeline applied to research abstracts. Here's a summary of the key aspects:\n\n*   **Dataset:** 312 research abstracts (biomedicine, computer science, social science), split into train/dev/test sets.\n*   **Prompting Strategies:**\n    *   (A) Instruction-only (baseline)\n    *   (B) Instruction-plus-schema (ours)\n*   **Sampling:** k=3 candidates per input.\n*   **Refiner:** Prefers candidates satisfying JSON schema constraints and penalizes hallucinated fields.\n*   **Router:**\n    *   Rule router (keyword-based)\n    *   LLM router (hypothesis prompt)\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Exact-match schema validity, F1 key-phrase extraction, accuracy domain routing.\n*   **Results:** Instruction-plus-schema improved schema validity and routing accuracy compared to the baseline, with a slight increase in latency.\n*   **Auditing:** Machine-readable diffs were logged.",
